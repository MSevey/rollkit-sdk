# Rollkit SDK

RappDK stands for "Rollkit application development kit". RappDK defines a set of standard for rollkit app using cosmos-sdk. It also introduces some new modules designed specifically for rollkit development. The goal here is to "rollkitifize" the cosmos sdk, making the "PoS-chain oriented" cosmos sdk be more suitable for rollkit.

Our set of standards for rollkit includes:

- App template (with list of modules)
- Default params for rollkit
- Guide to kickstart a rolllkit application
